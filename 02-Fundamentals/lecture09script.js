// A variable name cannot start with a number
// Variable names can only contain numbers, letters, underscores, or dollar signs
// Variable names also cannot be reserved keywords
/* The word 'name' is a reserved keyword, but still legl to use, but 
      it shouldn't be used as a variable name */

// We should not start a variable name with a capital letter...It's a convention for OOP
// Constants should be written in all caps
// Make variable names descriptive

LECTURE: Values and Variables
1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and
assign their values according to your own country (population in millions)
2. Log their values to the console
